 * Emits an AutoCloseable subclass declaration immediately before a try ARM block.
 * This is needed because AutoCloseable's close() method throws an exception
 * which we can't allow for compilation consistency so that means
 * we can't just create anonymous AutoCloseables in the try ARM clause.
 * We need to create anonymous ClRAutoCloseables.
 * <p/>
 * We emit a new ClRAutoCloseables declaration (they are numbered across the instrumentation session)
 * for each try ARM block because the Clover instrumenter doesn't easily support
 * forward references to types we may inject.
