# A Log4J confguration file for Groovy tests. It disables the logging on WARN level for
#   org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.m12n.SimpleExtensionModule
#
# A reason is that it writes the following:
#
# ... org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.m12n.SimpleExtensionModule getMetaMethods
#  WARNING: Module [groovy-all] - Unable to load extension class [class org.codehaus.groovy.jsr223.ScriptExtensions] due to [javax/script/ScriptEngine]. Maybe this module is not supported by your JVM version.
# ... org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.m12n.SimpleExtensionModule getMetaMethods
# WARNING: Module [groovy-all] - Unable to load extension class [class org.codehaus.groovy.jsr223.ScriptStaticExtensions] due to [javax/script/ScriptEngineManager]. Maybe this module is not supported by your JVM version.
#
# to stderr if
#   * the JDK used is older than JDK1.6 and
#   * the Groovy used is 2.x
#
# As a consequence our com.atlassian.clover.instr.groovy.TestSuite fails (test cases expect to have empty stderr)
# although it's just a warning and is not related with our tests.
